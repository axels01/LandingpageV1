# Startpage
A simple startpage for keeping track of links, mostly for personal use, nothing fancy.

&nbsp;

### Todo:
- Implement conversions subpage based on [axels01/UnitConverter](https://github.com/axels01/UnitConverter).
- Move the links and their test to pastebin or similar to avoid commits when just changing a URL or adding one.
- ~~Add clock.~~
- ~~Make buttons dynamically arrange themselves on mobile.~~
- ~~DuckDuckGo search bar dynamically size on mobile.~~
- ~~Add page icon.~~
